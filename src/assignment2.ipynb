    "In this assignment we will conduct data engineering for the Amazon dataset. The extracted features will be used for your next assignment, where you train a model (or models) to predict user ratings for a product.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Apache Spark for this assignment. The default Spark API will be DataFrame, as it is now the recommended choice over the RDD API. That being said, please feel free to switch back to the RDD API if you see it as a better fit for the task. We provide you an option to request RDD format to start with. Also you can switch between DataFrame and RDD in your solution. \n",

    "The input tables contain empty values, ```null``` values and dangling references. You do not to deal with empty values and dangling reference unless instructed. For ```null``` values we will follow the common practice in SQL world. Unless instructed otherwise, you need to ignore all the ```null``` value entries when calculating statistics such as count, mean and variance.
